# Code Refactor Challenge 1


## Description 

This project was built to refactor an existing web application's code to follow accessibility standards. Web accessibility is important as it ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies and the website is also optimised for search engines. 

Changes to the HTML and CSS code includes:

* Semantic HTML elements
* Accessible alt attributes
* Descriptive titles
* Adding a favicon at the web browser's tab  

The deployed application is linked [here](https://kautharamin.github.io/Code-Refactor-Challenge-1/)
